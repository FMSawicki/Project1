Bronze- Bare minimum functionality: the game lets you select a category with buttons, produces a hidden word with dashes the same length as the word, compares and replaces correct letters, lets you know when you win

silver- more features (adding incorrect guesses to visible list, more words for each category with randomized choices, add body parts for each incorrect answer), fix bugs

gold- prettier html and presentation
