html wireframe

//<head>

//<body>
   // div class='container'>
     //   div class='image'>
       //     
         //   form id="guess"> -Input submit
           // footer class="holder" id="hold"></footer>
       // aside>
         //   div>
           //     h1>Hangman!</h1>
             //   h4>Categories:</h4>
               // div> - buttons
                //h3 id="buttonRef">Guesses Left: </h3>


JS wireframe
//create initial word variables


//Category buttons

//function to generate hidden word

//functions for recieving input and modifying hidden word

//win condition

Major hurdles I encountered included trying to get the hidden word to clear when the array was updated and getting the input to work.

Bronze- Bare minimum functionality: the game lets you select a category with buttons, produces a hidden word with dashes the same length as the word, compares and replaces correct letters, lets you know when you win

silver- more features (adding incorrect guesses to visible list, more words for each category with randomized choices, add body parts for each incorrect answer), fix bugs

gold- prettier html and presentation
